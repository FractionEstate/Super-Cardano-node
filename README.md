# üöÄ Super Cardano Node

**A next-generation, high-performance Cardano node written in idiomatic Rust (2024 edition).  
Built for clarity, modularity, and protocol excellence.**

---

## üåü Vision

Super Cardano Node is more than a blockchain node‚Äîit's a showcase of modern Rust engineering, protocol rigor, and extensibility.  
Our mission: **deliver a robust, secure, and developer-friendly Cardano node that sets new standards for clarity, safety, and performance.**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture at a Glance

- **Idiomatic Rust:** Leveraging Rust‚Äôs safety, concurrency, and expressive type system.
- **Strict Modularity:** Each subsystem‚Äîconfiguration, networking, consensus, protocol, ledger, tracing, handlers, queries, wallet‚Äîis a clear, documented module.
- **Async/Await Everywhere:** All I/O and networking is async, powered by Tokio for massive scalability.
- **Multi-Era Protocol:** Supports Byron, Shelley, Allegra, Mary, Alonzo, and Conway eras, with a hard fork combinator for seamless upgrades.
- **Ouroboros Consensus:** Implements Praos and BFT, with extensible hooks for future consensus research.
- **Extended UTXO Model:** Full support for Cardano‚Äôs EUTXO, multi-asset, and Plutus script hooks.
- **Persistent ChainDB:** On-disk, async, rollback-capable database for blocks, UTXOs, and state.
- **Modern APIs:** Exposes both REST (Axum) and gRPC (Tonic) APIs for all node, chain, and wallet operations.
- **Integrated Wallet:** Key management, address derivation, UTXO selection, transaction construction/signing, and API endpoints.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and property-based tests for all critical logic.
- **First-Class Documentation:** Every public API and protocol detail is documented with Rustdoc and inline comments.
